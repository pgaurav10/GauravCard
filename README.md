## Goal

Gaurav Card aims to provide a professional portfolio platform for Gaurav, leveraging SwiftUI to showcase his contact details and a curated collection of iOS projects. The goal is to present Gaurav's skills and expertise in iOS development in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner, allowing potential employers or collaborators to easily view his work and get in touch.

## SwiftUI
Gaurav Card is built entirely using SwiftUI, Apple's modern and declarative framework for building user interfaces across iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. SwiftUI offers a robust set of tools for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces, simplifying the development process and enabling seamless integration with other SwiftUI views and components.

## Table View 
The app incorporates a table view to organize and present Gaurav's iOS projects in a structured manner. Table views are a fundamental component of iOS development, providing a flexible and efficient way to display lists of data. By leveraging table views, Gaurav Card ensures a clean and organized presentation of project information, allowing users to easily browse and select projects of interest.

## Web View 
When users tap on a project cell in the table view, Gaurav Card navigates to a detailed project description displayed in a web view. Web views enable the app to present rich, interactive content such as project details, screenshots, and external links. Integrating web views enhances the user experience by providing additional context and information about each project, while also allowing Gaurav to easily update and manage project details externally.
